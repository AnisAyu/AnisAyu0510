    <th>My name is Nor Anis Ayu binti Mohd Nazri. I was born on 5 October 2001 at Hospital Besar Kota Bharu, Kelantan. Now, I live at Terengganu. I have 4 siblings from different father which is 2 from real father and 2 from step father. I stayed with my step father more than 10 years since I was 8 years old and I glad knowing him as my best father ever. In my lesuire time, I love to spend my time with reading fact or motivational books. I have a collection that type books and I used my own money to buy it. Besides reading, I love to sleep because for me sleep is therapy to release my stress. I never like spend my time with outdoor activity.For my favorite color, I love pink, blue, red, white and yellow. But, the color most I love is pink. For my favorite drink is milo ice and my favorite food is fried rice. By the way, I also like all mom's cooking. My current place of study is UiTM Kedah and this year is my last semester as diploma student at there. My journey as diploma student in course Library Management was not like my imagination before because everything changed affect Covid19. It caused my friends and me continue our study in mode Online Distance Learning (ODL) but its never make us give up to finish our study very well. I always remind myself to bless with everything that Allah done for you because He is a best planner. So, trust and keep going strongly.</th>
